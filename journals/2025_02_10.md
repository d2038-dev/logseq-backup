			  collapsed:: true
				- most elements are block level elements by default
				- width 100% of their parent
				- height of 0
				- height grows to match the content
				- they stack one on top of the other
				- you can control the width and the height
				- try to avoid setting height
			- width and height control the content size, but for total element size you need to add padding, border and margin
