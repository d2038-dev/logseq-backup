			- Taking **regular breaks** prevents burnout and maintains productivity.
			  Short breaks (5-15 minutes) are beneficial for focus and energy.
			- **Growth mindset**: the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed.
			- **Grit**, defined as passion and sustained perseverance, is key to success.
			- **Encouraging a learning process** helps children value effort and growth.
			- **Focused and diffuse modes of thinking** are important for processing information.
			  Spaced repetition and active recall improve long-term retention.
			- **Action precedes motivation**; doing something creates momentum for further action.
			- **Consistency, persistence, and self-belief** are crucial for overcoming obstacles.
			- **Long-term planning** and avoiding last-minute panics are critical to overcoming procrastination.
			- **Developing better self-awareness** and addressing the root causes of procrastination are essential.
			- Focused practice and "chunking" information into manageable pieces improve learning efficiency.
			  Techniques like the **Pomodoro method** and **spaced repetition** are useful for retaining knowledge.

		- Tips and tricks
		  collapsed:: true
			- Avoid asking questions like "Can I ask a question?" in online communities.
			  Directly ask your question instead of waiting for permission, saving time for both you and others.
			- The XY problem occurs when someone asks about their attempted solution (Y) rather than the actual problem (X).
			  To avoid this, clearly explain the original problem (X) you're trying to solve, rather than just asking about your chosen solution (Y).
			- Rubber duck debugging is a method of solving programming problems by explaining them aloud, as if to a rubber duck.
			  The process of explaining forces you to think through the problem clearly, often revealing errors or new insights.
			- Effective searching is a crucial skill for solving programming problems using Google.
			  Use specific keywords and avoid overly broad or vague search terms.
			  Stack Overflow and GitHub are often the best sources of solutions, so include them in your search queries.
			- Ask clear and concise questions that provide enough context, code snippets, and the specific problem you're encountering.
			  Avoid posting walls of code—only include the minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue.
